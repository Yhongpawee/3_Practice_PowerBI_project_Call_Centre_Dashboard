# Problem Statement🔥📝
KPI's Requirements

1. Total Number of Calls: This metric tracks and displays the total number of calls received by the call center over a specified period.
2. Total Call Duration in Hours: This metric helps understand the total amount of time call center staff spends on calls in hours. This can be helpful in resource allocation and capacity planning.
3. Total Call Duration in Minutes: Similar to the total call duration in hours, this KPI provides the total call time but in minutes, offering a more granular view of call durations.
4. Average Call Duration in Minutes: This metric helps assess the efficiency of call center agents by calculating and displaying the average call duration in minutes. It can also help identify trends in call handling.
5. Response Time Percentage: Response time is a critical factor in customer satisfaction. This KPI should display the percentage of calls answered within a predefined time frame, helping gauge the call center's ability to meet customer service standards.
